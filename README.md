## Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis on film data obtained from various sources to hel our company as they venture into the film making industry. The task is to provide insights from the analysis to help the company make decisions on the kind of films to make to maximize profit and audience engagement.

## Business Understanding
The company seeks to enter the movie industry after seeing other big companies make original video content. They decide to create a studio, however they have no idea on the type of movies to create. The task is to determine the type of films currently doing well at the box office and help the company determine the kind of movies to make.
Some of the key business questions to be answered include:
* What genre of films does the best at the box office?
* Is there a correlation between the production budget and the performance of a movie at the box office?
* What is the correlation between movie runtime and the Return of Investment?
* What is the average production budget for films over the years?

## Data Understanding and analysis
The data used in this analysis contains data collected from various popular movie sites such as Box Office Mojo, IMDb, rotten tomato reviews. It contains detailed information on movie titles, actors, directors, box office earnings, and movie ratings.

## Recommendations
The following are recommendations drawn from the analysis done:
1.  The company should have a sizeable production budget when creating the films. There was a strong positive relationship between production budget and the global gross profit of a film. More money towards production would lead to higher production quality in terms of graphics and cinematography drawing in more viewers.
2. The company should make movies of a longer runtime. Whilst there some isolated scenarios where short films still earned a hefty global gross profit, I found a general trend of profit increasing for longer runtime.
3. The company should make movies that are animations as that was the genre that had the highest average global gross profit of all genres. Action, adventure, musicals and scientific fiction should also be considered as they also had good performance at the box office.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis done has provided useful insights for my company as we venture into the film making industry. It is important that these recommendations be included together with other factors to make the best decision for the company.
